      <h5 class="mega push-0">Overview</h5>
      <p>This project was to animate a scene with depth in After
        effects by creating a foreground, middle-ground, and
        background applications could be animating a still image
        through projection mapping, a walk cycle within a horizontal
        scene, parallax scrolling (website/app), transitioning
        from one scene to another. A strong concept will
        take you further than precise execution. Consider using
        parallax to add value to an otherwise ‘static’ scene - add
        depth . The scene doesn’t need to be complex, it’s about
        creating the illusion of depth.</p>

        <p>I decided that I really wanted to do a jungle scene with
          the sun rising in the background. I really love elephants,
          and I thought it would be really cool to have them walking
          through the jungle with the camera spanning out in
          order to create depth. This was a really fun project and
          gave me an idea for designing an interactive children’s
          book in the future.</p>
