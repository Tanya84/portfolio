      <h5 class="mega push-0">Overview</h5>
      <p>I conceived a concept for an isometric illustration.  The criteria was that the theme must be obvious to a majority of people, and the illustration needed to explain a process.  This was my fist experience ever creating this type of illustration, the theme I came up with was acrtic exploration because i'm in love with the arctic especially it's wild life.</p>

      <p class="iso-decription gutter pad-t">The first concept I came up with was this one on the left! It turned out to be more of a scene and less of an isometrics illustration, so I scrapped this idea and went back to the drawing board.</p>
