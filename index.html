      <p class="max-width">Heyo! Tanya here, and I am yes you guessed it, a Graphic designer!  Ever since I was able to pick up a pencil i’ve always loved to draw, it was something that just came to me naturally.  Whenever I was asked as a kid what I wanted to be when I grew up I always was quick to shout out an Artist!  I was often told from a young age that there was no future in the arts, and unfortunately for many years those influences led me down the wrong path.  I’ve always been a creative person with a fierce love for the arts so one day I decided to take a chance on myself and as corny as this sounds to follow a dream.  I think that is a huge part of why I love being a graphic designer, because in a way it’s making a clients dream a reality.</p>
