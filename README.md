Hi! I'm Tanya D an up an coming graphic designer from Ottawa.  I've had a fierce love of the arts for as long as I can remember

Weather it's renisannce to pop art, I find beauty in everything especially the strange and unusual.  Creativity is something we are all born with and being out in nature with the sound of water, soft grass and wind blowing through the trees is what allows mine to sore. My strong connection with the earth is also what keeps me grounded nature is the creation of life and that is truly the essence of design.
